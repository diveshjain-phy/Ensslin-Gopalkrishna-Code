## EG_all_phase ##

This set of codes produce spectra for all phases once 
1. Del_t
2. Tau
3. Volume
4. Magnetic field
5. Norm obtained

for all phases is specified.

## Files and there uses: ##

allphase.py : User has to modify the above 5 parameters to produce meaningful spectra.
op.py       : Contains all functions required for calculations of the spectra in allphase.py

## Output ##

A plot is created based on values of paramters specified.
