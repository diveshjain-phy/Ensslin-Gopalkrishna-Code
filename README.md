# Ensslin-Gopalkrishna-Code

# EGfit: 

Contains code which results in best fit paramters on terminal and the best fit plot for the phase guessed by the user

**Parameters for the best fit maybe unphysical, hence go for EG_best30_params**



# EG_best30_params:

Contains code which results in 30 lowest chi values and its corresponding parameters for the system. Output file **parameters+"values of spectral index specified by user"**

# EG_all_phase :

Generates plots for all phases from parameters derived from the above set of codes.
